## Iron man

I haven't seen most of avengers movie,but most of them said **Iron man** is best.    
I also witnessed that most of them crying and feeling bad when **Iron man** died in 'Avengers End game'.    
Also i am thalapathy fan, Most of them will say thalapathy is best suited to do ***Iron man*** role.

He was the first member recruited for the group, and for good reason: 
He’s got the tech — and the billions of dollars — that the Avengers depend on.
